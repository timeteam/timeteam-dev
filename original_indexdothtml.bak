                <p>This site is mainly about books and reading.  It is intended as my own memory aid, to document to my future self what I found interesting in what I have read, and in so doing, to hopefully improve my memory of it.  Content includes some fiction including science fiction but more non-fiction, especially science-related.</p>

	<p>The first of these pages were created in November 2015 but post dates are the date I first read the book, not necessarily the date the file was posted.  Some dates are speculative (books on the in-tray).  Some are as yet empty, to be gradually filled from emails and other sources.  Most entries from earlier than 2015 will be based on re-reading. Titles followed by an asterisk are empty placeholders with reviews yet to be entered.</p>
			
		<p>Notes on books and reading are arranged chronologically under the <a href="/archive.html">journal</a> link, and also by notional <a href="/category">category</a>. A few biographical links are here also under the <a href="/about.html">about</a> header link and some other <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> will appear also.
